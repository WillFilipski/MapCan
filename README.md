### Where to Obtain Files:
As the files are too large to be uploaded, they will need to be downloaded prior to running the R code. This will also familiarize the user with the source of this data for future elections.

1. ![2021 Federal Election results](https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rep/off/44gedata&document=byed&lang=e). Select "format 2."

2. ![Federal electoral districts](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/47a0f098-7445-41bb-a147-41686b692887). Download .dbf and .shp files.

3. ![Canadian cartographic boundary file](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb). Download .shp file.

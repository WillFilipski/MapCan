# MapCan
General R code for visualizing and mapping official federal election data from Elections Canada.

### Where to Obtain Files:
As the files are too large to be uploaded, they will need to be downloaded prior to running the R code. This will also familiarize the user with the source of this data for future elections.

1. Election results may be obtained from "https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rep/off/44gedata&document=byed&lang=e" (select "format 2").

2. Federal electoral districts shapefile can be obtained from "https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/47a0f098-7445-41bb-a147-41686b692887" (select .dbf, .shp).

3. Canadian cartographic boundary file can be obtained from "https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb" (select .shp).

### Sample Output
Here is a sample output of the R code. Future versions will include relative colouring based on the win margins.
